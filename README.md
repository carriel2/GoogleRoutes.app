# GoogleRoutes.app
 A simple frontend that collects the device's current location and allows the user to enter as many addresses as they want, in any order. These addresses are sent to the backend, which processes and organizes the optimal route. Then, the frontend generates a URL and opens Google Maps on the device with the optimized route.
